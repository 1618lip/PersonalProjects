## Folder Structure

The workspace contains several folders:
- `src`: Contains `App.java` and `Arduino File.ino`
- `lib`: Contains the `jSerialComm.jar` library used by `App.java`
- `bin`: Contains the generated compiled output files

## About the Project:
I was fascinated by the idea of controlling mundane tasks on the computer without even touching it.
