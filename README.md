# PersonalProjects
This is the place where I displayed all of my mini personal projects I had done for fun. 
Feel free to use the code as you wish as long as you cite my name. 
If you have any questions about the projects (code, circuitry, etc), feel free to shoot me an email at ppincencia@ucsd.edu
